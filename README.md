# React Old School calculator

## Description:

![ScreenShot](JsSuper90.png)

This project is a personal project as part of a Free Code Camp certification program to enhance my skills in React development. The main objective behind this project was to recreate a vintage calculator with a nostalgic 80/90's aesthetic.

During the development process, my primary focus was the CSS and styling to achieve the desired retro appearance.

As this project was created some time ago, it currently follows older React development practices.

This was an excellent way to have a practical introduction to Virtual DOM and single-page applications in general.

The solar panel look I got from following this article [this article](https://dev.to/catlogic/styling-the-catlogic-calculator-in-css-d7i)
for the solar panel.

## Things to Improve

- Refactor the codebase by migrating from class components to functional components.
- Introduce Typescript to ensure a more robust and type-safe codebase.
- Using CSS-in-JS to streamline the styling process and improve code maintainability.
- Adopt a more DRY approach to render the Buttons with a function.
